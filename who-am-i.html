           Hey its Michael!
        </h1>
<p>After a couple years in pharmacy, I realized that while I loved solving complex problems,
I wanted to build the systems that drive modern solutions.</p>
 <p>My world revolved around clinical logic, patient safety, and zero-error environments 
 as a Licensed Pharmacist. <p>While I loved the analytical challenge of healthcare, 
 I found myself increasingly drawn to the "how" behind the systems
 I used—wondering how software could better manage complex data to improve lives.
<p>I didn't just want to use the tools anymore; I wanted to <b>build them.<b></p>
